Dataset attached is just a starter version so you can start working on the QNN modelling.
I have also attached version of classical CNN model but not very optimized but hopefully you can use it to look at the dataset and predictions.
Since dataset is very small right now, CNN will not train very well but it will improve as we increase dataset size above 2k sims. Right now it is 300 only.
